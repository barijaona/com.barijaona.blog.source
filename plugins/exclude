=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: exclude

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: ignores files and directories in entries. Still allow these stories to appear in the results of a search via Fletcher T. Penney's find plugin <http://fletcher.freeshell.org>
 
This plugin does not make any new variables available for use in template files.

=head1 VERSION

2024-01-06blosxom2

Version number is the date on which this version of the plug-in was created.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

C<$ign_file> name to use for exclude files. Defaults to C<exclude>.
A file extension can be added to the name, to specify that this particular file (Ex: C<exclude.html>) is specific to a flavour. 

C<$refdir> directory where you put the exclude files. It is recommended to use what is defined by the flavourdir plugin.
Falls back to your datadir if it is not defined.
exclude files are parsed following the hierarchical structure of your datadir / flavourdir. 

C<$show_if_exact_match> defines if Blosxom should display an individual story when its exact URL is requested.  

=head1 EXAMPLE

Your C<exclude> file should look like this:

apps/
life/about.txt

One entry per line. You should be able to use regexes.

=head1 BUGS

Some plugins running ahead of the filter routine might still display links to excluded stories. This makes the security risks
inherent to activating C<$show_if_exact_match> higher.

Works with recent versions of Blosxom2 (2.0.1 or later).

Every version is tested with the latest revision of Blosxom available at the date of publication <https://sourceforge.net/p/blosxom/blosxom/ci/master/tree/>.
Please send bug reports and feedback to the author.

=head2 CHANGES

2024-01-06blosxom2 : default behavior is now to hide a file even when the requester is able to guess its exact URL ;
fix loading of patterns ; fix static rendering of individual stories ; change name match to be case insensitive.

2006-01-02blosxom2 : takes into account the modified call of filter subroutines in recent versions of blosxom.cgi.
Tested with Blosxom CVS revision 1.9  (modified 18th December 2005).

2004-09-13blosxom2 : First published version. Very hackish, needed a specific version of blosxom.
