=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: fedifeedback

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Purpose: Populates $fedifeedback::shortlink and $fedifeedback::explainedlink
with some HTML to link to a “toot” (which should link back to your article),
which will serve as an “anchor” for a comment thread.

=head2 REQUIRED METADATA ITEMS

=over 4

=item Feedback

An URL pointing to a Mastodon or Fediverse post which will serve as an anchor
for visitor's comments.

=back

=head1 USAGE

fedifeedback should be loaded after your meta plugins (typically either 
L<metamail> or L<meta>).

Once the plugin is integrated, you will change your publication workflow as
follows:

=over 4

1/ you will publish your blog post, without Fediverse discussion enabled
yet (no toot ID).

2/ you will write a post on Mastodon (or any similar system supporting
the Fediverse like GoToSocial, PixelFed, Pleroma, Friendica, Misskey…).
This post (“toot”) should link to your blog post, and be designed to provide
increased visibility to it. It will allow users to easily share and engage with
your content, as they can simply “boost” (similar to retweet) your toots to
share them with their followers.

3/ grab the “toot” URL and change your blog post to include it.

4/ republish the website.
