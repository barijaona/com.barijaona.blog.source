# Blosxom Plugin: sublog
# Author: Brian St. Pierre <brian@bstpierre.org>
# Download: http://bstpierre.org/Projects/sublog
# Version: 1
# License: MIT style
# Purpose: To allow weblog-like stuff to be included in a blosxom weblog
# as a $sublog::sublog variable.

# The posts in your sublog are similar in format to blosxom posts: the
# first line is the title, the rest is the body. Including
# $sublog::sublog in your template will give you a <div
# class="sublog"> element that contains a <div class="sublog_title">
# and <div class="sublog_body"> for each post.
#
# This does not support flavors.


# INSPIRED BY / BASED ON:
#
# Blosxom Plugin: sideblog
# Author: infozo <infozo@infozo.info> http://infozo.info
# Version: 20030708
# License: caveat emptor
# Purpose: to read the first handful of lines from a sideblog file
# containing not-quite-ready-for-prime-time blog material (be it
# uncommented links, simple verbal quips, or unformulated thoughts)
# into a variable made available to the head/foot files.
