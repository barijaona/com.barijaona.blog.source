Using Blosxom starter kit with Apple's OS X Server

This is mainly a note to myself, about my blogging tool.

In 2015, if you want a tool to create a blog, you will probably consider [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll : transform your plain text into static websites and blogs."). It is :

- simple (no database, just text files),
- safe (static site, no pesky updates to install, just your content)
- and free (as in beer as well as in speech).

OK, but version 1.0.0 of Jekyll had to wait May 2013 to be available, and even version 0.0.0 wasn't published before October 2008.

My personal site has always been static. As soon as October 2003, I started using [Blosxom](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blosxom/ "Blosxom at Sourceforge") which is currently considered as [the grandfather](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/03/20/5-minimalist-static-html-blog-generators-to-check-out/ "5 Minimalist Static Blog Generators to Check Out") of minimalist static site generators. Less than a year later, I packaged it in an attempt to make the generation of a static blog a little easier. Call me old… Probably lazy and maybe narrow minded too, because I see no compelling reason to switch for my personal use.

My setup is derived from the standard [Blosxom starter kit](<$url />/web/blosxomsk/en/announcement_20040921.html "Announcement : Blosxom starter kit").

I currently use Apple's OSX Server, which is available to me through Apple's Developer Program. Therefore, the `blosxom.cgi` script is installed inside `/Library/Server/Web/Data/CGI-Executables`. The `$datadir` variable in the script points to a public folder in my home directory. Inside this folder, the Unix group of `plugins/state/` and its content should be set to `_www`.

In the `/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/other` folder, I have a `blosxom.conf` file which just contains the following line :

	ScriptAlias /blog "/Library/Server/Web/Data/CGI-Executables/blosxom.cgi"
	
And here it is, I can see the rendering of my blog at http://localhost/blog …

To generate its static version, I have a script which basically perform a :

	perl /Library/Server/Web/Data/CGI-Executables/blosxom.cgi  -password="MyNotSoImportantPassword"

The static version is pushed to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com "Websites hosted from GitHub repositories") through `git`. And that's it.
