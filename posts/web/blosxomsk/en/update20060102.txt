meta-creation_date: 2/1/2006 23:59:56
Late Christmas gift <a href="<$url /><$path />/../blosxomsk_20060102.zip" title="316Ko, Jan 2nd, 2006">is available for download</a>...

It is based on a recent version of blosxom.cgi ([CVS revision 1.9](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/blosxom/blosxom2/ "Sourceforge")) which has removed many bugs, and as a consequence required to change some plugins :
* some hacks in flatarchives and categories plugins were removed because they are no more required* updated prevnextstory and pagetype plugins to handle the fixed $path_info information* updated the exclude plugin to the new method of handling the filter subroutines  (much cleaner for static rendering !)

This version also includes the recent version of prefs plugin which is more friendly in case of errors in preferences files.

Plugins version numbers :

* prevnextstory : 2006-01-01blosxom2
* pagetype ; 2006-01-01blosxom2
* exclude : 2006-01-02blosxom2
* prefs : 2005-11-20

Reminder : the most recent release will always be available at <a href="<$url />/download/blosxomsk.zip"><$url />/download/blosxomsk.zip</a>
