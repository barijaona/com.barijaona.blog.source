Publishing a blosxom blog on a Mac.com account
meta-creation_date: 13/3/2004 12:02:33

This post will probably irritate some french speaking readers as well as lovers of the english language, but this is a quick and dirty adaptation of an e-mail which may be useful for other people.

<div lang="en">Many MacOS X users users are interested in running a <a href="http://www.blosxom.com" title="The zen of blogging">blosxom</a> blog ; they may also have a <a href="http://www.mac.com/" title="Apple">mac.com</a> account.

Following <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blosxom/message/7060" title="remote hosting / .mac">a request in the blosxom mailing list</a>, here is a short description of my configuration for publishing a blosxom blog on a mac.com account.

.Mac does not run CGIs, so Blosxom runs on my local machine.

<h1>1/ Initial setup</h1>

My datadir must be readable by the www user, so I put it at :

bq. <code>$datadir = "/Users/my_macintosh_username/blosxom/posts";</code>

(replace my_macintosh_username by your short login name)

The plugins are configured this way :

<blockquote>
<p>
<code># --- Plugins (Optional) -----</code>
</p>
<p>
<code># Where are my plugins kept?</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>$plugin_dir = "/Users/my_macintosh_username/blosxom/plugins";</code>
</p>
<p>
<code># Where should my modules keep their state information?</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>$plugin_state_dir = "$plugin_dir/state";</code>
</p>

</blockquote>

I setup the access rights for the state directory (/Users/my_macintosh_username/blosxom/plugins/state) to 775, owner www, group my_macintosh_username.

Blosxom is used to generate static pages on the Sites directory of my home, so that I can preview the site before uploading to .Mac through the URL http://127.0.0.1/~my_macintosh_username

<blockquote>
<p>
<code># --- Static Rendering -----</code>
</p>
<p>
<code># Where are this blog's static files to be created?</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>$static_dir = "/Users/my_macintosh_username/Sites";</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<h1>2/ Day to day use</h1>

After writing a post, I run a shell script which generates the static pages :

bq. <code>perl /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/blosxom.cgi -password="My_static_password_here" ${*}</code>

This script contains also instructions to rename some files to my liking (for instance, I find it easier having index.rss renamed rss.xml, index.atom renamed atom.xml...) and delete other files which I don't want to upload (for instance the daily archives, because monthly archives are enough for me...).

I can then check my writing by browsing at http://127.0.0.1/~my_macintosh_username.
After doing so, I upload to my iDisk through a shell script invoking rsync :

bq. <code>rsync -vaz --size-only --exclude=.DS_Store --stats --progress ~/Sites/ /Volumes/my_dotmac_login/Sites/</code>

(replace my_dotmac_login by what is adequate). Of course, you'll have first to mount your iDisk to run the above.

To speedup the rsync process, you can add other --exclude options, for instance for the older archives. In fact, my current script contains :

bq. <code>rsync -vaz --size-only --exclude=.DS_Store --exclude=2002 --exclude=2003 --exclude=myPictures --stats --progress ~/Sites/ /Volumes/barijaona/Sites/</code>

<h1>3/ Further enhancements you can consider</h1>

My setup uses the prefs plugin, which I use instead of Rael Dornsfed's <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/general/config.htm" title="blosxom.com">config plugin</a> because of some problems I encountered with static rendering, and <a href="<$url />/download/prefs" title="Prefs plugin">can be downloaded here</a>.

Among other things, this plugin is used to set a meta variable to the base address, whether blosxom runs in dynamic or static mode (http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi or <$url />).

I use this meta variable in my templates in a ==&lt;base ...&gt;== HTML directive, so that links within the blog function both in dynamic and static rendering.
