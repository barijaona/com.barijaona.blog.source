If you search for <q>static site generator</q> in a search engine, you‚Äôre unlikely to come across any mention of "Blosxom"[^amazon]. However, an [article from 2012](https://siliconangle.com/2012/03/20/5-minimalist-static-html-blog-generators-to-check-out/ "5 Minimalist Static Blog Generators to Check Out") states that <q><i>Blosxom is the original open source static site generator</i></q>.

[^amazon]: Worst, the first result when searching "the zen of blogging" is an Amazon book titled "The Zen of Blogging: Make money with your blog, fire your boss and live the good life" üò¢üôÑ

#### A long ride with Blosxom

I could not agree more. Since [October 2003](https://blog.barijaona.com/web/bascule_sous_blosxom.html hreflang="fr" "Bascule sous Blosxom"), this blog has been statically generated with Blosxom. Back then, I ran into issues with some plugins that I had to debug or rewrite, which [led me to package a Blosxom starter kit](https://blog.barijaona.com/web/blosxomsk/en/announcement_20040921.html "Announcement of Blosxom starter kit in September 2024") for anyone willing to try out Blosxom's "static rendering".

There never was a strong enough reason to change, so I stuck with my system. However, some frustrations emerged over time:

- the state of abandonment of the Blosxom website[^1];
- concerns about potential legal and privacy issues which might arise from the use of an external commenting system (though I never had specific problems with Disqus);
- a relative decline in the blogging ecosystem, which led to a shift in conversations moving to social networks;
- a feeling that I could get better interactions with open web standards.

[^1]: I hope I'll have more about that in upcoming posts.

#### Attraction to the Fediverse

I was aware of [WebMentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention "W3C Recommendation for interactions across the web"), but was never motivated enough to give a try at implementing it.

Then two flushes of motivation came from discoveries :

- [@rolle](https://mementomori.social/@rolle "Roni Laukkarinen, owner of
mementomori.social")'s blog, with this particular post : [Comment to a WordPress blog post via the Fediverse](https://rolle.design/comment-to-a-wordpress-blog-post-via-the-fediverse "rolle.design, December 2023");
- a portion of Coralie Mercier's [interview](https://www.w3.org/blog/2024/on-the-55th-world-standards-day-my-history-of-the-web-and-relationship-with-w3c/) on the history of the Web and her relationship with W3C (starting at 14:50)

#### A new commenting system based on Mastodon

After [the ensuing conversation](https://w3c.social/@koalie/113288170505154472 "Discussion on W3C.social"), I had a tentative timeframe for implementing a solution.

The initial setup was quite manual, but this post marks the "official" release of the [fedifeedback plugin for Blosxom](https://sourceforge.net/p/blosxom/blosxom-plugins/ci/master/tree/barijaona/fedifeedback/ "Directory content in Blosxom blosxom-plugins repository").

Once installed, using the plugin is straightforward:

1. publish your blog post, without enabling Fediverse discussion
yet (i.e., no toot ID).

2. write a post on Mastodon (or any similar system that supports
the Mastodon API, like GoToSocial, PixelFed, Pleroma, Friendica, Iceshrimp, Sharkey, etc.).
This post (‚Äútoot‚Äù) should link to your blog post and help
increase its visibility. It will allow users to easily share and engage with
your content by boosting your ‚Äútoot‚Äù to their followers or reply to it.

3. grab the ‚Äútoot‚Äù URL and update your blog post to include it.

4. republish the website.

Example: the source text of this article can be found at: [https://github.com/barijaona/com.barijaona.blog.source/blob/master/posts/web/fediverse/en/Fedifeedback-plugin-for-blosxom.txt](https://github.com/barijaona/com.barijaona.blog.source/blob/master/posts/web/fediverse/en/Fedifeedback-plugin-for-blosxom.txt).

Some of the code (Javascript and CSS) is derived from [Daniel Pecos Martinez](https://danielpecos.com/2022/12/25/mastodon-as-comment-system-for-your-static-blog/ "Mastodon as comment system for your static blog")'s [web component](https://github.com/dpecos/mastodon-comments "Mastodon-Comments on Github"). However, I modified it significantly to align with my vision of Blosxom's philosophy. And for the first time in my life, I have included a part entitled _ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS_ in a software documentation‚Ä¶
